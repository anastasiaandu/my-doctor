# **My Doctor App**
### This was a project done in collaboration with: 
- Audun Young.
- Pranav Prashar.
- Me.

My Doctor helps you find a doctor and book an appointment based on your abilities and language. This app takes differently-abled people into consideration.

## ***Technologies***: 
1. React: JS library allowed to quickly add visual components that can be reused throughout the app. It allowed for nice rerendering as our app state changed. 
2. Sass: Superset of CSS that easily helped break down styling with BEM convetion.

Project completed in under 24 hrs.
